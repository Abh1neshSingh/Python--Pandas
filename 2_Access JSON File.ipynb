For a simple pd.Index, the row index name is preserved using `to_csv()`. However, the column index name is not preserved. This is unexpected, and at least could be [documented](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html)\\r\\n2. For the corner case with a pd.MultiIndex using one level, pd.read_csv() fails to read the multi-header back in.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know, it\\'s a corner case. However, the fact that the column index can have a name, and the fact that column and header are both represented using the same object, it is somewhat unexpected that those inconsistencies occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : fd3f57170aa1af588ba877e8e28c158a20a4886d\\r\\npython                : 3.10.5.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 21.6.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 21.6.0: Thu Sep 29 20:13:56 PDT 2022; root:xnu-8020.240.7~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\\r\\nmachine               : arm64\\r\\nprocessor             : arm\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : None.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.23.1\\r\\npytz                  : 2022.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 58.1.0\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : 0.29.30\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.2\\r\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.2\\r\\nIPython               : 8.14.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.7.1\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.9.0\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

Trying the analogous `read_parquet` it times out and seems as if it can\\'t resolve the region. My S3-compatible instance is on-premises so there isn\\'t a \"region\", however setting `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to `\"\"` also did not solve this.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly, supplying either of `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` to `storage_options` or supplying the `filesystem` argument fixes this. Worth noting that in my `~/.aws/config` file the `region` and `ca_bundle` values are provided (as is `endpoint_url`).\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI think `read_parquet` should behave like `read_csv` and be able to access and read the data without passing in additional configuration.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : fd3f57170aa1af588ba877e8e28c158a20a4886d\\r\\npython                : 3.9.16.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 4.18.0-513.9.1.el8_9.x86_64\\r\\nVersion               : #1 SMP Thu Nov 16 10:29:04 EST 2023\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.1.0\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : 8.18.1\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.2.0\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : 2024.2.0\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.19.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",

pandas.\\r\\n- [X] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Issue Description\\r\\n\\r\\nApparently, it is not possible to read in a .csv table with named column index AND named row index.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to reproduce:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\nimport numpy as np\\r\\n\\r\\nnp.random.seed(0)\\r\\ndf = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(5,3), \\r\\n                  columns=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]).round(1)\\r\\ndf.index.name = \"Count\"\\r\\ndf.columns.name = \"Name\"\\r\\n\\r\\n# INCONSISTENCY 1: \\r\\n# .to_csv() only saves the row index name, it ignores the column index name.\\r\\ndf.to_csv(\"out.csv\")\\r\\n\\r\\n# The work-around: convert to column index to MultiIndex\\r\\ndf.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([df.columns])\\r\\n\\r\\n# Now, .to_csv() stores both column and index names.\\r\\ndf.to_csv(\"out.csv\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is how the file looks like:\\r\\n\\r\\n```lang-none\\r\\nName,A,B,C\\r\\nCount,,,\\r\\n0,1.8,0.4,1.0\\r\\n1,2.2,1.9,-1.0\\r\\n2,1.0,-0.2,-0.1\\r\\n3,0.4,0.1,1.5\\r\\n4,0.8,0.1,0.4\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, when reading in, I found no way to preserve both the index name of row and column indices.\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\ndf_new = pd.read_csv(\"out.csv\")\\r\\nprint(df_new)\\r\\n# ==> Line 1 is a row instead of column header\\r\\n\\r\\ndf_new = pd.read_csv(\"out.csv\", header=[0])\\r\\nprint(df_new)\\r\\n# ==> Line 1 is a row instead of column header\\r\\n\\r\\ndf_new = pd.read_csv(\"out.csv\", header=[0, 1])\\r\\nprint(df_new)\\r\\n# ==> Creates a two-level multi-index column header\\r\\n\\r\\ndf_new = pd.read_csv(\"out.csv\", header=[0, 1], index_col=[0])\\r\\nprint(df_new)\\r\\n# ==> Creates a two-level multi-index column header\\r\\n\\r\\ndf_new = pd.read_csv(\"out.csv\", header=[1], index_col=[0])\\r\\nprint(df_new)\\r\\n# ==> Correctly create the row index, but loses the column info\\r\\n\\r\\ndf_new = pd.read_csv(\"out.csv\", header=[1], index_col=[0])\\r\\nprint(df_new)\\r\\n# ==> Correctly create the row index, but loses the column info\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nI think this behavior is inconsistent, as switching to a multi-index with two or more levels works as expected:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n# INCONSISTENCY 2:\\r\\n# A multi-index column header with >1 levels is handled correctly\\r\\ndf_mh = df.copy()\\r\\nl1 = list(\"ABC\")\\r\\nl2 = list(\"abc\")\\r\\ndf_mh.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([l1, l2])\\r\\ndf_mh.columns.names = [\"Name1\", \"Name2\"]\\r\\ndf_mh.to_csv(\"out_mh.csv\")\\r\\ndf_new = pd.read_csv(\"out_mh.csv\", header=[0,1], index_col=[0])\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis reads in the CSV correctly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following SO posts are related:\\r\\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35047842\\r\\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67499614\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, I identified the following inconsistencies:\\r\\n1. For a simple pd.Index, the row index name is preserved using `to_csv()`. However, the column index name is not preserved. This is unexpected, and at least could be [documented](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html)\\r\\n2. For the corner case with a pd.MultiIndex using one level, pd.read_csv() fails to read the multi-header back in.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know, it\\'s a corner case. However, the fact that the column index can have a name, and the fact that column and header are both represented using the same object, it is somewhat unexpected that those inconsistencies occur.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : fd3f57170aa1af588ba877e8e28c158a20a4886d\\r\\npython                : 3.10.5.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Darwin\\r\\nOS-release            : 21.6.0\\r\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 21.6.0: Thu Sep 29 20:13:56 PDT 2022; root:xnu-8020.240.7~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\\r\\nmachine               : arm64\\r\\nprocessor             : arm\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : None.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.23.1\\r\\npytz                  : 2022.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 58.1.0\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : 0.29.30\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.2\\r\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.2\\r\\nIPython               : 8.14.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.7.1\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : 2.9.0\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n', 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57453/reactions', 'total_count': 0, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'timeline_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57453/timeline', 'performed_via_github_app': None, 'state_reason': None}\n",

Trying the analogous `read_parquet` it times out and seems as if it can\\'t resolve the region. My S3-compatible instance is on-premises so there isn\\'t a \"region\", however setting `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to `\"\"` also did not solve this.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly, supplying either of `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` to `storage_options` or supplying the `filesystem` argument fixes this. Worth noting that in my `~/.aws/config` file the `region` and `ca_bundle` values are provided (as is `endpoint_url`).\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI think `read_parquet` should behave like `read_csv` and be able to access and read the data without passing in additional configuration.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : fd3f57170aa1af588ba877e8e28c158a20a4886d\\r\\npython                : 3.9.16.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 4.18.0-513.9.1.el8_9.x86_64\\r\\nVersion               : #1 SMP Thu Nov 16 10:29:04 EST 2023\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.0\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 69.1.0\\r\\npip                   : 24.0\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : None\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\r\\nIPython               : 8.18.1\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.2.0\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : None\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : 2024.2.0\\r\\nscipy                 : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.19.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n', 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57449/reactions', 'total_count': 0, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'timeline_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57449/timeline', 'performed_via_github_app': None, 'state_reason': None}\n",
